# Custom Discs v4.4 for Paper 1.21.5

A Paper fork of henkelmax's Audio Player. Special thanks to Athar42 for maintaining this plugin. 
- Play custom music discs using the Simple Voice Chat API. (The voice chat mod is required on the client and server.)
- Use ```/customdisc``` or ```/cd``` to view available commands.
- Music files should go into ```plugins/CustomDiscs/musicdata/```
- Music files must be in the ```.wav```, ```.flac```, or ```.mp3``` format.

Downloading Files:
- To download a file use the command ```/cd download <url> <filename.extension>```. The link used to download a file must be a direct link (meaning the file must automatically begin downloading when accessing the link). Files must have the correct extension specified. An UnsupportedAudioFileException will be thrown in the server's console if the file extension is not correct (for example when giving a wav file the mp3 extension). Below is an example of how to use the command and a link to get direct downloads from Google Drive.
- Example: ```/cd download https://example.com/mysong mysong.mp3```
- Direct Google Drive links: https://lonedev6.github.io/gddl/

Set the range of a disc:
- To set the active range of a playable disc, just use the command ```/cd range <range>```. The range can be between 1 and the max value set in the config file (default : 256)
- Example: ```/cd range 100```

Permission Nodes (Required to run the commands. Playing discs does not require a permission.):
- ```customdiscs.create``` to create a disc
- ```customdiscs.download``` to download a file
- ```customdiscs.range``` to set the range of the disc

Dependencies:
- This plugin depends on the latest version of ProtocolLib for 1.21.5 and SimpleVoiceChatBukkit version 2.5.30.
